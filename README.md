# Practical 1 - Image Processing and 2D Transformations

## Objective
This practical aims to introduce students to fundamental image processing techniques, including image representation, grayscale conversion, and 2D transformations, using programming libraries such as OpenCV or similar tools. The practical is divided into two parts:

### Practical 1a: Image Representation
1. **Convert an image to a matrix**: Students will load an image and display its pixel values as a numerical matrix.
2. **Display the image in RGB and Grayscale**:
   - RGB: Display the image in its original color format.
   - Grayscale: Convert and display the image in grayscale.

### Practical 1b: 2D Transformations on an Image
Students will perform the following 2D transformations on an image:
1. **Translation**: Shift the image by a specified distance in the x and y directions.
2. **Rotation**: Rotate the image by a specified angle.
3. **Scaling**: Change the dimensions of the image proportionally or non-proportionally.
4. **Shearing**: Skew the image along the x or y axis.
5. **Reflection**: Create a mirrored version of the image along a specified axis.

Note : you can use any image of your choice.
